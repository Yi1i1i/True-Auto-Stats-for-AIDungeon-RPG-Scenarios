TRUE AUTO STATS (TAS) FOR AI DUNGEON RPG SCENARIOS
By Yi1i1i

Current AI models fail to accurately keep track of stats and have a hard time interpreting quantity in regards to numbers which forces players to manually create their own stats and update them. This is tedious and reduces immersion.

TAS aims to...

Create and automatically update the player's stats according to the user's input and the AI's output.

Allow the player to easily edit their own stats if they want to.

Interpret the stats and relay them to the AI such that the AI can understand and incorporate the influence of the stats itself.

Reduce the need for strict or unnatural command formats which pollutes AI context and reduces immersion.

Provide a limit to the player's omniscient power.
